// Parameter computation helper functions for MLAB/M20K based IP
//
// The basic idea is that if you want to use an MLAB, you are going to use an
// entire MLAB regardless of whether you want 1 address or 32 addresses. In the
// case of a FIFO, there is a small area penalty for widening the address bus,
// however the extra pipeline elasticity that using all 32 addresses provides is
// most likely worth the few extra registers. Likewise for an M20K, no advantage
// to using less than 512 addresses. However, M20K can have different geometries
// so it might be better to use more. For example, for a 1-bit wide fifo, may as
// well use the 2048x10 configuration instead of 512x40. All geometries in this
// file are supported across all FPGA families that use M20K. As future work,
// one could add specialized support for geometries in A10 or older devices.
