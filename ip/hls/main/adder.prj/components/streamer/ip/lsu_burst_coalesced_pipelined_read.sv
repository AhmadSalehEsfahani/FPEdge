// This module implements a burst-coalesced read LSU with extensive pipelining
// to acheive the best possible Fmax.  This module has been designed with a
// HyperFlex architecture in mind.
//
// An LSU is a 'load store unit'.  Since this is a Read LSU, it is really a
// load unit, meaning it fetches data from global memory for a kernel.  An LSU
// is essentially an adapter between the kernel side interface and the Avalon
// bus that connects to the memory interconnect.  
//
// The LSU also needs to pass valid signals (each valid is also called a 
// 'thread') on to the Kernel.  Every thread which enters the LSU must leave 
// the LSU.  For a read LSU, every thread is associated with a word of data.
//
// Along with the 'valid' signal, each incoming thread has a 'predicate' signal.
// NOTE: the 'predicate' signal in this interface should actually be called
// 'predicate_n', since a '0' on this signal means the transaction is
// predicated (should generate a write to memory), and a '1' on this signal
// means the transaction is NOT predicated (should not generate any transaction
// to the memory).
//
// The 'coalescing' part of this LSU involves taking the addresses from several
// threads and grouping them together.  Data sent to the kernel are
// called 'kernel words', and data from the memory through the Avalon
// interface are called 'memory words'.  Kernel words may be smaller than or
// the same width as memory words.  There are two levels of coalescing, both
// of which are supported by this LSU.  Within-word coalescing involves taking
// several kernel words which all map to a single (larger) memory word and
// sending them as a single memory word read.  Burst coalescing invlovles
// taking several (possible within-word coalesced) adjacent memory words
// and grouping them together into a single Avalon burst.
//
// Stall latency protocol is supported by this LSU, and is enabled by the
// USE_STALL_LATENCY parameter.  The internal i_stall to o_valid latency
// of the block is controlled by the DOWNSTREAM_STALL_IN_EARLINESS parameter.
