// This is a latency 2 MLAB only variant of acl_mid_speed_fifo. Use hld_fifo with STYLE = "mlab" to gain access to this fifo implementation.
//
// Starting from empty, mid speed fifo takes 3 clocks to become non-empty after accepting input data:
// First clock cycle: fifo input data is written to the RAM
// Second clock cycle: fifo issues a read to the address previously written to
// Third clock cycle: read data is available from the RAM, which drives the fifo output data
//
// For RAM blocks that natively support new data mode in mixed port read during write, the fifo can issue the read one clock cycle earlier and get the newly written data.
// MLAB natively supports this mode whereas M20K does not. If one were to build bypass logic around the M20K, it would end up looking similar to acl_latency_one_ram_fifo.
//
// This fifo can benefit from STALL_IN_EARLINESS up to 1, in which there is some manual retiming of fmax sensitive signals. Additional earliness is simply
// absorbed with a shift register, likewise for any VALID_IN_EARLINESS.
