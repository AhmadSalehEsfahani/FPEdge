  // If this is a banked local memory LSU, then permute the address bits such
  // that:
  // 1. If there is no user specified bank bits attribute, then place
  //    consecutive words in different banks. (Default Banking)
  // 2. If there exists user specified bank bits attribute, then follow the
  //    attribute.
  // Do this by shifting the bank bits to the top of the aggregate local memory
  // address width.
  // Bank select bits in original address are:
  //      addr[(BITS_IN_BYTE_SELECT+MIN_BANK_BIT) +: BANK_SELECT_BITS_HACKED]
  // Note: MIN_BANK_BIT cannot be greater than WORD_SELECT_BITS, otherwise the
  // entire memory will be put in one bank and other banks are left empty.
  // The permuted address is organized as:
  // { ( High order bits untouched ),
  //   ( Bank select bits ),
  //   ( Word address bits within a bank ),
  //   ( Byte select within a word ) }
  // Not all fields are present in all configs (some configs don't bank,
  // others don't have any depth to banks so no word select bits).

  // Note that ABITS_PER_LMEM_BANK includes bits for the within-bank word
  // select, the within-word byte select, and the pipelined workgroup select
  // bits.

  // To get a better understanding of how the address is permuted, consider the
  // following address:
  //   -------------------------
  //   |  D  |  C  |  B  |  A  |
  //   -------------------------
  // where:
  //   A are byte select bits
  //   B are non-banked word select bits
  //   C are bank select bits to be shifted
  //   D are upper bits that will be moved below C
  // Note: C and D may not have the same number of bits.
  // After the permutation, the result is:
  //   -------------------------
  //   |  C  |  D  |  B  |  A  |
  //   -------------------------
