// This module tracks whether FIFO occupancy is above a predefined threshold. Since the occupancy can only change by +1, 0, or -1,
// only the lower bits of the used_words counter need to be timing exact. For example, say we want to detect if occupancy >= 2. We
// activate if occupancy==1 and increasing, and we deactivate if occupancy==2 and decreasing. To detect if occupancy is 1 or 2,
// the bottom 2 bits of used_words needs to be exact, but the upper bits can be 1 clock cycle late. If the occupancy is 1 or 2 right
// now, then 1 clock cycle ago it must have been in the range of 0 to 3 inclusive. This technique is applied recursively, e.g. the
// higher bits of used_words are more stale. If we want a different threshold, then we adjust the reset value of used_words.
//
// This module was designed in conjunction with acl_high_speed_fifo.sv. The testbench is grouped together with the fifo.
//
// Required files:
// -acl_tessellated_incr_decr_threshold.sv
// -acl_reset_handler.sv
//
// TEMPORARY FIX:
// Reset values are set to match the behavior of before reset cleanup. See FB case:457213. This is a workaround for now.
// Eventually the compiler needs to set the reset parameters correctly, at which point the default values will be set
// back to the original intent, which is for someone who knows nothing about the reset in their system.
