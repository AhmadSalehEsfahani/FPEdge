// This module implements burst coalescing as a bump-in-the-wire architecture. It accepts word addresses and tries to form avalon bursts by looking for sequential word addresses. To play
// nicely with HLD global interconnect, this module also does not allow bursts to cross a burst boundary. That means if the max burst size is 16, bursts cannot cross a boundary of 16 words.
// Note this module only operates on word addresses whereas most of the LSU operates on byte addresses.
//
// The result of burst coalescing is one request for each burst. This is fine for read requests, but a write burst of length B is transferred over B clock cycles. To simply the fifo read 
// control inside the write LSU, every read from the avm_ctrl_fifo results in one read from the avm_wr_data_fifo. The avm_ctrl_fifo is the output from the burst coalescer and ultimately 
// drives avm_address and o_avm_burstcount. The avm_wr_data_fifo is the output from the write data aligner and ultimately drives avm_writedata and avm_byteenable. To make the read count from 
// these fifos match, there is a repeater inside this module which receives one burst of length B from the burst coalescer and write B copies of this into the avm_ctrl_fifo.
//
// The input to this module may also seem a bit strange, the actual word address that burst coalesce operates on is i_base_addr + i_add_to_base_addr. Why not do the add outside this module?
// Because the adder is tessellated, and we can start comparing if the addresses are sequential on the lower bits while the upper bits are still being added. This is why the adder lives 
// inside this module. The purpose of i_add_to_base_addr is for when a kernel word spans more than one memory word, since i_base_addr is the word address of the first memory word, we need 
// to compute i_base_addr+1 for the second memory word, and i_base_addr+2 for the third memory word that this kernel word touches. If i_add_to_base_addr is known to be 0 e.g. the LSU is 
// aligned, one pipeline stage can be removed to save area.
//
// If one is using read cache, burst coalescing inside the LSU is disabled, and there is a burst coalescer inside the cache to make bursts for cache misses. Additionally, the read LSU has
// throttle logic to not request more reads than it has space for. The cache capacity is at least as large as the throttle threshold, therefore the cache will never backpressure the burst
// coalescer inside the LSU, and so avm_ctrl_fifo can be bypassed.
//
// Even if burst coalescing as a feature is not used, one still needs to pass signals through this module for the adder (i_base_addr + i_add_to_base_addr) and the fifo (the unaligned
// controller operates with stall latency, must have enough downstream space available to catch things in flight).
//
// For additional info, refer to hld_global_load_store.sv (top module of entire LSU) and hld_lsu.sv (top module of the core LSU).
