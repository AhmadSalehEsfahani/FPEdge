// This module tracks the processing of each kernel word as it spans multiple memory words. Up to 3 memory words per kernel word is supported, however if it
// is statically known that kernel words can only span fewer memory words then some logic can be trimmed away.
//
// This is the central controller which reads from the cmd fifo (output of word coalescer) and steers all of the pipelined logic from reading the input fifos
// to aligning the kernel write data to the memory interface. The burst coalescer is also controlled by this.
//
// The read LSU has a second instance of this unaligned controller for the response data. This instance steers all of the pipelined logic from reading the 
// avm_rd_data_fifo to aligning the memory read data to the kernel interface.
//
// For additional info, refer to hld_global_load_store.sv (top module of entire LSU) and hld_lsu.sv (top module of the core LSU).
